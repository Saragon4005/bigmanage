# BigManage
A discord bot designed to manage channel permissions and moderation in a scalable form

# Setup
Currently I am building this bot in Python 3.8, but there is compatability with 3.6+.
The dependencies can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Might need sudo).
A file named `.bot_token` will be created by running `encryptedtokengen.py` with python and giving it the token found in the discord developer portal.
After all this is done main.py needs to be executed using Python
